Simple, **unofficial** extension to interact with GitHub Actions from within VS Code.

## Installation

2. Open a repository with a `github.com` origin
3. When prompted, enter a PAT with `repo` scope to authenticate against the API

## Features

### View workflows for the currently opened repository

### Trigger runs

If a workflow uses `repository_dispatch` as a trigger, you can start a new workflow run from the workflow context menu:

Or from the workflow list:

Or from the editor when editing a workflow:

### Pin workflows and see their status updated automatically

You can pin workflows to the status bar per workspace, and automatically see the status of the most recent run. For example, to see if the change you just pushed passes the CI Build:

1. To setup, configure the `"github-actions.workflows.pinned.workflows"` property on a global level, or per workspace (`.vscode/settings.json`):

```json
{
    "github-actions.workflows.pinned.workflows": [".github/workflows/build.yml", ".github/workflows/create.yml"],
}
```

2. To enable auto-refresh via polling, set `refresh.enabled` to `true`. This works by polling the workflow runs API with a default interval of `30` seconds. You can customized the interal via `refresh.interval`:

```json
{
    "github-actions.workflows.pinned.workflows": [".github/workflows/build.yml", ".github/workflows/create.yml"],
    "github-actions.workflows.pinned.refresh.enabled": true,
    "github-actions.workflows.pinned.refresh.interval": 65,
}
```
